#What's this?
This is a piece of code that uses Python and CERN's PyROOT library to plot data on a graph. It was written during the
IT stage at CERN. The produced graphs are like these:<br>
![plot1](plot1.png "Plot 1") ![plot2](plot2.png "Plot 2")

1. First, install ROOT library from [CERN's official website](https://root.cern.ch/downloading-root)
